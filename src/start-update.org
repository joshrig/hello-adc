* How to integrate a new START archive into the project
  - save the following files to a safe place
    driver_init.[ch]
    gcc/Makefile
  - remove all directories and files EXCEPT the following:
    LICENSE
    README.md
    src/
    patches/
  - unzip the new archive in the top-level directory.
  - edit gcc/Makefile (if necessary)
    - remove the fucked up line, emacs will tell you which one
    - remove "examples" references
    - add the source files in "src/"
    - edit the include paths "../" to "./"
    - edit the linking line "../" to "./"
    - edit the linking line to get rid of the "specs" file reference
  - remove main.c from the top-level
  - apply patches to:
    hpl/dmac/hpl_dmac.c
    driver_init.c
    driver_init.h
  - touch(1) all the files.
