* How to integrate a new START archive into the project
  - remove all directories and files EXCEPT the following:
    LICENSE
    README.md
    src/
  - unzip the new archive in the top-level directory.
  - edit gcc/Makefile
    - remove the fucked up line, emacs will tell you which one
    - add the source files in "src/"
    - edit the include paths "../" to "./"
    - edit the linking line "../" to "./"
    - edit the linking line to get rid of the "specs" file reference
  - remove main.c from the top-level
  - touch(1) all the files.
  - make sure to save the ATSTART file in the src/ directory for later
    use.
