* Temperature sensor configuration (page 1619)
  - device has 2 sensors
    - TSENSP
    - TSENSC
  - controlled by SUPC
  - you'll need the coefficients from calibration NVM
  - how to select the temperature sensor
    - if SUPC.VREF.ONDEMAND = 0 && SUPC.VREF.TSEN = 1 && SUPC.VREF.VREFOE = 0
      - then the sensor is selected by writing to SUPC.VREF.TSSEL
      - the mux input selection bits don't matter, other than at least
        one being enabled, (I assume?)
      - VREFOE must be OFF in this configuration
    - if SUPC.VREF.ONDEMAND = 1 && SPUC.VREF.TSEN = 1
      - then the sensor is selected by the ADC's mux bits
        - 0x1B Bandgap reference (whose voltage is selected in SUPC)
        - 0x1C PTAT
        - 0x1D CTAT
      - VREFOE can be ON and selected in this configuration.
  - XXX what does the datasheet mean when it says that if you select
    the temperature sensors or the interal reference channels then the
    Sampling Time Length bit group in the Sampling Control register
    must be written with a corresponding value? (page 1638)
